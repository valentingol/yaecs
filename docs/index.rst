This package is a Config System which allows easy manipulation of config
files for safe, clear and repeatable experiments. In a few words, it is:

-  built for Machine Learning with its constraints in mind, but also
   usable out-of-the-box for other kinds of projects;
-  built with scalability in mind and can adapt just as easily to large
   projects investigating hundreds of well-organized parameters across
   many experiments;
-  designed to encourage good coding practices for research purposes,
   and if used rigorously will ensure a number of highly desirable
   properties such that **maintenance-less forward-compatibility** of
   old configs, **easy reproducibility** of any experiment, and
   **extreme clarity** of former experiments for your future self or
   collaborators.
